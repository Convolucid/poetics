This house is made of bricks
And holey disregard
Like latticework within,
A perforated nervous system
Synecdoche: the brains of the operation.

This skull is made of wax
And every fissure is a wick
Molded lard as thick as thieves,
And lecithin from mashed-up brains
Tans my taxidermied hide.

I should have used sunscreen,
I should have used sunscreen and lotion all along
Just like you did.

But now the ashy snow is riddled
With a thousand crows feet
Embossed in bold,
Their wings black as island sands,
As fallen seraphs roasted over open flames.

Volcanic!
This is not my type of face,
And I laughed

And I screamed my youth into oblivion,
Bargained for a soul
The trade uneven,
And yet the contract parchment curled
In stranger ways

Into and upon itself, refusing to abide
By natural law, spoiled to its own physics
And permanently unsettled
To this plane.
Askew, flickering
A z-fight wrestled along an axis so foreign
No wonder could describe it
‘s no wonder

Could you take my hand,
From that locus?
Or have the locusts gnawed the latticework
So profoundly
That even this gulf between hearts
Has grown a hole?

I’ll take my answer off the air.
